## Installation

1. Transfer the `dod_addon` folder from this repository into the `Half-Life` folder within your Steam installation directory.
1. Edit the properties of the game in Steam and set the following launch option to [enable addon content](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/GoldSrc/SteamPipe_directories#.3Cbase.3E.2F.3Cmod.3E_addon).

> [!NOTE]
> It's advisable to set the current `dod/config.cfg` file to `Read-only` to prevent any modifications.

## Extras

### Launch Options

Consider using these additional launch options: `-realtime -tickrate`

### `_cvarlist.cfg`

The `dod_addon/_cvarlist.cfg` file lists all the default console variables of the game.

It has been generated by executing the command `cvarlist log` in the console of a freshly installed game copy of [Day of Defeat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/30/Day_of_Defeat/).
