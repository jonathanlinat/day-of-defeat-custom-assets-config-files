## Installation

Transfer the `dod` folder from this repository into the `Half-Life` folder within your Steam installation directory.

You'll be asked to overwrite the current directory and files. Additionally, it's advisable to set the current `dod/config.cfg` file to `Read-only` to prevent any modifications.

## Extras

### `_cvarlist.cfg`

The `_cvarlist.cfg` file lists all the default console variables of the game.

It has been generated by executing the command `cvarlist log` in the console of a freshly installed game copy of [Day of Defeat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/30/Day_of_Defeat/).

### Launch Options

Consider using these launch parameters: `-high -nojoy -nomsaa`
